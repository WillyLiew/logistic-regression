# logistic-regression
Studying the effects of different learning rate on reducing the costs value of model
This model applies logistic regression for cat identifier model. 
The input, X is picture which may be a cat or not and the output, Y is 0 or 1 to indicate whether it is a cat or not.

log_reg file contains the main function for manipulating the learning rate when training the model. 
logReg.pickle is used to save the parameters after training the model in log_reg for future convenient usage
lr.utils.py cotains the load_data function for loading the data from datasets file
